I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Knowledge-Based Systems group](https://iccl.inf.tu-dresden.de/web/Wissensbasierte_Systeme/en) led by [Markus Krötzsch](https://iccl.inf.tu-dresden.de/web/Markus_Kr%C3%B6tzsch). My research interests include rule-based reasoning, rule analysis, graph query languages, and theories of computation. I have also worked on *Theory of Programming Languages* (e.g., with Ursula Goltz, [Uwe Nestmann](https://www.mtv.tu-berlin.de/nestmann/), and [Rob van Glabbeek](http://theory.stanford.edu/~rvg/)) and *Formal Methods of Software Product Lines (SPLs)* (e.g., with [Malte Lochau](https://mbe.informatik.uni-siegen.de/team/prof-dr-rer-nat-malte-loch/), [Ina Schaefer](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/isf/team/schaefer), and [Thomas Thüm](https://www.uni-ulm.de/in/sp/team/thuem/)).

I received my Bachelor's degree (B.Sc.) from the [University of Rostock](https://www.informatik.uni-rostock.de/) and my Master's degree (M.Sc.) from [TU Braunschweig](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/informatik). I defended my dissertation *Non-Standard Semantics of Graph Query Languages* in 2020. My doctorate was supervised by [Wolf-Tilo Balke](http://www.ifis.cs.tu-bs.de/staff/balke).
